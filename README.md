# Water-Supply-System-Management
This project involves the development of a C++ application designed to manage and optimize a water supply system. The application leverages the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. The system incorporates various heuristics to identify optimal points for adding or removing pipes without disrupting the overall efficiency and functionality of the network. <br>
